let’s say you initialize a variable: long num = 100L;

it is the same as writing: long num=100;

In the latter case, Java detects that we are trying to make a long variable and hence does this:

Since the number is small and fits under integer type, it assigns the variable as
int var = 100; 
2. It is then cast to long type.

long num = (long) var; 
To avoid this two-step process, we directly give the ‘L’ suffix to the long variable being declared. This concept applies to float and double as well. Float is assigned as a double variable by default and then cast to float type later.
