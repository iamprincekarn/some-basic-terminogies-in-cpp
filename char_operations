if any arithmetic operation performed between two char then the answer would be integer which will be the sum of ascii value of both the characters
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    char c1 = 'A';
    char c2 = '!';
    cout<<c1+c2<<endl;
    return 0;
}


if we try to put this sum value in any other char variable then it will store it as the char value of that integer ascii number
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    char c1 = 'A';
    char c2 = '!';
    char c3 = c1+c2;
    cout<<c3<<endl;
    return 0;
}


if one variable will be char and other is integer then the answer would be same
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    char c1 = 'A';
    int x = 2;
    char c3 = c1+x;
    cout<<c1+x<<endl;
    cout<<c3<<endl;
    return 0;
}
